# Classroom Activity

## Why Use Text Mining in Your Teaching?
- Like a lot of other DH tools, Text Mining can:
    - Get students to think differently by stepping outside the usual routine of traditional reading, writing
    - Provide students with an opportunity to get familiar with technical tools and methodologies

## Why analog?
- Comprehensive coverage of DH tools often requires access to a wide variety of technology
    - The settings needed for teaching these tools can be difficult to create
    - Or maybe you just want to keep technology out of the classroom

- *Digital Methodologies*, with or without computers, can get us to think in refreshing new ways...
    - Because there is less to learn from a software perspective, the learning objective is easier to achieve
    - There is an added benefit of stripping away the speed of a computer and emphasizing what the digital tool actually does
    - A single-session digital methodology activity is a low-risk way to try out Digital Humanities: it's unlikely to have any long-term negative effects for the class, but instructors will still capitalize on the positive effects of an activity change

## This activity will:
    
- Incorporate collaboration and close reading to identify themes across text 

- Provide students with directed rules for reading (shift the object of students' engagement to more closely parallel the instructor's object)

- **Ultimately, this type of activity helps students develop the psychological tools that underpin the disciplinary practices common to a professional scholar**

# A Practical Analog Example: Text Mining by Hand

{% include figure.html img="personmine2.jpg" alt="intro image here" width="40%" %}

{% capture text %}
1. Read the short story
2. Track, by hand, the number of times important `characters` show up
3. With your group, determine important `themes` in the text
    3. Track by hand the number of times these important `themes` show up
4. With your group, use markers and paper to represent the importance of each `character` and `theme`. Distinguish between **size**, **weight**, and **color**
5. Present the dominant themes and characters that you identified
