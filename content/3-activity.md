## Why Use Text Mining in Your Teaching?
<br>
### Like a lot of other DH tools, Text Mining can:
- Get students to think differently by stepping outside the usual routine of traditional reading, writing
- Provide students with an opportunity to get familiar with technical tools and methodologies

<br>

---
<br>
## Why analog?
- Comprehensive coverage of DH tools often requires access to a wide variety of technology
    - The settings needed for teaching these tools can be difficult to create
    - Or maybe you just want to keep technology out of the classroom

- *Digital Methodologies*, with or without computers, can get us to think in refreshing new ways...
    - Because there is **less to learn from a software perspective**, the learning objective is easier to achieve
    - There is an added benefit of **stripping away the speed of a computer** and emphasizing what the digital tool actually does
    - A single-session digital methodology activity is a **low-risk** way to try out Digital Humanities: it's unlikely to have any long-term negative effects for the class, but instructors will still capitalize on the positive effects of an activity change

## This activity will:
{% capture text %}    
- Incorporate collaboration and close reading to identify themes across text 

- Provide students with directed rules for reading (shift the object of students' engagement to more closely parallel the instructor's objective)

- **Encourage students to develop the psychological tools that underpin the disciplinary practices common to a professional scholar**

# A Practical Analog Example: Text Mining by Hand

{% include figure.html img="personmine2.jpg" alt="intro image here" width="40%" %}

You can access the reading for this activity <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/wilde/178/" target="_blank">here</a>.

{% capture text %}
1. Read the short story
2. Track, by hand, the number of times important `characters` show up
3. Form groups
4. With your group, determine important `topics (or themes)` in the text
    - Track by hand the number of times these important `topics` show up
5. With your group, use markers and paper to represent the importance of each `character` and `topic`. Distinguish between **size**, **weight**, and/or **color**
6. Present the dominant themes and characters that you identified
