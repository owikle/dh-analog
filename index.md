# Teaching Digital Humanities with Analog Tools

{% include figure.html img="book.jpg" alt="intro image here" width="75%" %}

Teaching the concept of text mining without computers.

*It's difficult to guarantee access to the range of tools needed to bring digital humanities into the standard classroom, especially when it's not feasible to schedule every single class session in a computer lab. But one of the most exciting aspects of digital humanities is that it's what we do with the tools, not the tools themselves, that matters. This session introduces the basics of text mining, a technique that provides several different approaches to exploring and reading large swaths of information, and sends you home with an activity that you can adapt and use to introduce your students to text mining, no matter your discipline or the digital capacity of your classroom. No background in text mining is necessary to participate; beginners welcome.*
